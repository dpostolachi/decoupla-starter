# Decoupla Gatsby Starter

This project is a starter Gatsby application built with TypeScript, demonstrating how to integrate with Decoupla CMS, using the [gatsby-source-decoupla](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-source-decoupla) plugin. It's designed to provide a quick setup for a blog, fetching content from a pre-configured Decoupla sandbox account.
